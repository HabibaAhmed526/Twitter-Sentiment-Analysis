# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Using machine learning techniques and text extraction, we are going to be predicting the sentiment of the text whether it is positive or negative. This ensures that companies save a lot of amount by understanding the sentiment of texts given by users during different instances of time respectively.

## Project Workflow
   * Preprocessing of raw tweet text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
   * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution
   * Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings
   * Model training and evaluation using machine learning classifiers
   * Visualization of sentiment distribution and model performance
